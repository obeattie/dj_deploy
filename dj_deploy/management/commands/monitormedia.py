"""The monitormedia management command, for monitoring any of the (uncompressed)
   media files. Each time a change occurs, the media files are assembled but *not*
   compressed. This means that they are preprocessed (if there are preprocessors
   for the file types defined) but time is not wasted on unnecessary calls to
   compressors."""
